# Setup
In order to setup the environment locally you must use two seperate terminals, one to set up the website and one to setup the server.
How to do so is explained below.

## Website Setup

Open a terminal at the root folder of the repo.
First we cd into the website folder
`cd website`

We then install on dependencies using
`yarn install`

If you alread have yarn installed you can check by using
`yarn --version`

We then enter the following to begin
`yarn start`

## Server Setup

Open a terminal at the root folder of the repo.
We first cd into the folder rosae-server
`cd rosae-server`

We then use the following install the node programs
`npm install`

We then use the command below to activate the server
`npm start`

# Possible Improvents
- Improved verbalisations
- More dynamic search queries
- Better visulaisation of the knowledge graph
